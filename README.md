# Gilli

1. Simply, a project over [Groovy](http://groovy.apache.org/)
1. A [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) 
   Platform + Lot of built-in DSLs for day to day purpose
1. It can be used for day to day routing scripting needs or automation
1. It can be used in any `Java` based enterprise grade application to
   quickly bring functionalities using its DSLs. Obviously, developer
   and testing productivity improves 
1. Lot of built-in utilities for quick scripting your day to day needs
   without any boiler-plate coding
   * Yes. It can be done in any programming language. But,
     Gilli hides the complexity of programming
     behind the screens
   * The platform natively targets non-developers also like Testers, Software
     support personnels, System administrators and any one who wants to
     automate their routine tasks and scripting syntax are chosen 
     accordingly
1. All those quick scripting are made possible using lot of built-in
   [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)s.
1. Some Examples
    * Database Querying and doing transformations and formatting
    * Publish and consume REST API in `2 lines of code` only your
      business logic eats lines... :) 
    * `awk` like file processing utility in command line itself
    * Evaluating simple expressions or unit conversions in the command
      line itself
    * Creating your own custom commands to quickly run the implemented
      DSLs with changing inputs
    * Lot of Scientific/Metric Unit conversions. Ability to plugin your
      own units with conversion capabilities
    * piping output from OS comamnds to Gilli
      and back to OS commands for your work
    * It is just charm to use API powers of Java, Groovy and Gilli
      in command lines
1. In addition to built-in DSLs, Write your own DSLs as Plugins of this platform and use it along with
   built-in DSLs
1. Combining the available DSLs and using it : `Sky is the limit` for this
   `Ex: Create Excel File with DB Query results, apply some formulas in
   less than 5 lines`
1. Ability to Run Gilli as backgound OS process to do
   your custom works continuously that too in `5 lines of code`
1. Enormous utilities in the command line
1. `Plus Lots`
